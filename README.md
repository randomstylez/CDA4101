# CDA4101

This project uses multicore processing and simple mpi to access FIU's ursula system 

This project takes a set of websites and compares them to a provided website
by taking all of the words and putting them into an array and comparing the likeness of each word
to give a similarity indicator.

The non parallel file does this also but with the use of only the master core from ursula.
